## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 3 hours daily beats 10 hours once a week
2. **Pattern Recognition**: After solving 5 problems of a pattern, you'll start recognizing it
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Review problems after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days
4. **Mock Interviews**: Start from Week 3, do 1-2 per week (use Pramp - it's FREE!)
5. **Don't Memorize**: Understand the WHY behind each solution
6. **Time Management**: Spend max 45 min per problem, then check solution
7. **Code Quality**: Write clean, commented code as if in a real interview
8. **Think Out Loud**: Practice explaining your approach during mock interviews
9. **Use Pramp Weekly**: It's free and gets you comfortable with live coding
10. **Record Yourself**: Watch your mock interviews to identify improvement areas

## 🎤 DIY Mock Interview Setup (100% Free Alternative)

Can't use Pramp? Create your own mock interview environment:

1. Pick 2 random LeetCode problems (1 easy, 1 medium)
2. Set a timer for 45 minutes
3. Use Google Doc (not IDE!) to simulate whiteboard coding
4. Record yourself on Zoom explaining your approach out loud
5. Watch the recording and critique yourself
6. Track these metrics:
   - Did you explain your approach clearly?
   - Did you consider edge cases?
   - Did you analyze time/space complexity?
   - Did you test your code with examples?
